SurfCraft Guru - Virtual Surfboard Shaper & Recommendation Engine 

Provisional Patent Submitted 

SurfCraft Guru is an app delivering highly customized surfboard generation and recommendations based on individual rider style, skill/fitness, and geographic wave conditions; harnessing advanced Python libraries, machine learning/AI models, and API integration to connect surfers to independent shapers of their choice and support small businesses. 

This groundbreaking app that acts as a Virtual Surfboard Shaper as well as a Surfboard Recommendation Engine. For the first option, the app delivers surfers highly personalized recommendations for surfboard models in the market from different brands, leveraging factors such as skill level, body type, wave conditions, and individual riding style. Using this same parameters, the app also includes an an option called “Virtual Board Shaper” to allow surfers to design their custom board from scratch. This option would implement advanced Python libraries to deploy unprecedented machine learning and AI models for highly customized surfboard generation. The feature then creates a formal blueprint of their customized board, and integrates with Google Maps Platform for Developers to connect them to local shapers in their geographic area, or to an independent shaper of their choice to get their customized surfboard design built.

The app allows surfers to discover personalized recommendations for different surfboards from both popular and local brands, as opposed to recommendations engines that are currently available by popular individual brands. The Virtual Shaper feature allows surfers to bring their unique custom board design blueprint to a shaper of their choice to support local and small business, as opposed to customized boards that are currently available by a few select popular brands only.

Technical Description:

1. Backend Development:
The backend of the app would handle data processing, machine learning models, and API integrations. Python would be a suitable choice for its versatility and strong support for machine learning. The popular Flask or Django frameworks could be used to develop the backend, providing a solid foundation for building the application's logic and handling HTTP requests.

2. Machine Learning and AI:
   The app's most innovative feature, the "Virtual Board Shaper," relies on advanced machine learning and AI models. Python offers numerous libraries for this purpose, such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch. These libraries provide high-level APIs and tools for training, deploying, and using machine learning models. TensorFlow, for example, is a popular choice for its wide range of pre-built models and ease of use.

3. Data Collection and Storage:
   To deliver highly personalized recommendations, the SurfGear Selector app would require a comprehensive dataset of surfboard and fin models, along with associated factors like skill level, body type, and wave conditions. This data could be collected from various sources, including user input, APIs, and web scraping. The collected data could be stored in a database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

4. Frontend Development:
   The app's frontend would be responsible for presenting the recommendations to users and capturing their preferences. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be used for building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). Additionally, modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular could be employed to create a dynamic and interactive UI. These frameworks facilitate component-based development, allowing for reusable and modular code.

5. API Integrations:
   The SurfGear Selector app might integrate with external APIs to gather additional data, such as wave conditions or surfboard specifications. For example, APIs like Surfline or Magicseaweed could provide real-time surf forecasts. Python's libraries like Requests or aiohttp enable easy communication with RESTful APIs, allowing the app to fetch and process data from these sources.

6. Deployment and Hosting:
   To make the app accessible to users, it needs to be deployed and hosted on a server. Deployment platforms like Heroku, AWS (Amazon Web Services), or Google Cloud Platform could be utilized for this purpose. These platforms offer scalability, reliability, and various deployment options, ensuring the app can handle user traffic effectively.

7. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   Throughout the development process, comprehensive testing should be conducted to ensure the app functions correctly. This includes unit testing individual components, integration testing for different modules, and end-to-end testing to verify the app's workflow. Tools like pytest, Selenium, or Cypress could be used to automate and streamline the testing process.

8. Version Control and Collaboration:
   Git would enable version control effective collaboration among the development team. Hosting the code repository on platforms like GitHub or GitLab allows for seamless code management, versioning, and coordination of feature branches, ensuring a smooth development workflow.

Overall, the app would be built using a combination of Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The backend would be developed using Flask or Django, employing Python's machine learning libraries like TensorFlow. The frontend could be developed using frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular. API integrations, data storage, and deployment would rely on various technologies and platforms to provide a robust and scalable solution.
